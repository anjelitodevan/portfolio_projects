## 1. Movie Data Analysis

Analyze the correlation of a movie budget and its revenue. 
Also, the lists of highest grossing directors and actors.

###   Disclaimer

  The analysis is only as good as the data. Finding a good movie data is pretty hard
  since many websites now do not share their data freely.
